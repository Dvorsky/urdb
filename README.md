An web app for tracking media you're watching/reading/playing.
For each media you add you have options such as (for movies): "Finished" and "Plan to watch"


UPDATE 21/01/2018 - After finishing support for tracking movies, started working on frontend with Vue.js. 

Final version will have options for movies, TV shows, games and books.
